# Bias-Detection-Mitigation-in-Text

## Product Overview

This solution is Unsupervised learning method that solves problem of Bias in unstructured data (Text Corpus). It identifies and reduces the bias present in the word embeddings. The user can target a specific bias (Gender, Age, Race etc.) to be identified and mitigated, without loss in semantic meaning  of words in the corpus. These trained and de-biased word vectors can then be utilized in language models powering applications like unbiased word prediction, unbiased word suggestion for replacement words in sentences, unbiased sentence generation, etc.

## Product Highlight
* Bias: Detection & Mitigation algorithm is unique implementation, able to handle unstructrued data like 'Text Corpus'. It performs all processes only based on user provided inputs (text corpus, bias specific seed words, bias direction defining pair of words, and category specific word list) in a single zip file.  This algorithm also reduces Bias associated with frequency features in the Text corpus. The alogorithm considers constraints such as minimum and maximum frequency of words in Text corpus, presence of symbols, Gender Direction etc.
* This solution is primarily optimized for Gender De-Biasing case, but can be effectively and readily applied for any other case of Bias cases like Racism, Sexism, Ableism,  etc. It can help organizations improve the bias neutrality in decision making through models using this algorithm's output DeBiased vectors. This solutions also helps reduce the direct or indirect cost associated with lost revenues / Customers, employees dissatisfaction, legal and compliance risk, damaged Brand reputation etc.
* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
